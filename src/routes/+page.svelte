    Hey, I’m Pankaj! I’ve been building on the web since 2011 — back when WordPress themes were the coolest thing around (and honestly, they still are). These days, I work my magic with JavaScript, PostgreSQL, UI/UX, and AI integrations, creating web experiences that are fast, functional, and a little bit addictive. I’m the kind of guy who can spend hours perfecting a layout or talking about cars, gadgets, and design trends. Fueled by curiosity and coffee, I just love turning ideas into things people actually enjoy using.
